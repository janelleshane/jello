Let it simmer for a few minutes to make tomato soften.Add little cooked shrimps and let it simmer for a few minutes so as it takes the flavor of the other ingredients. Don’t let it simmer for too long, because shrimps will be rubbery.Let it cool.Preheat the oven at 425°F.Unroll the flaky pastry on a oven tray and spread the shrimps garnish by letting the sides empty.Roll the dough and fold the sides down so as to shape it as a yule log.Bake for 30 minutes.Put the tarama in a pipping bag. Decorate your lug log on taste and creativity.We have made little balls decorated with some lump roes.If you buy whole shrimps and pretty big, hull them and cut them into very small pieces.It’s important to not spread the garnish while it still hot (or even warm) on the flaky pastry, to avoid it becomes soft and too flexible.@@@@Creamy Lime Jello SaladINGREDIENTS8 oz cream cheese softened 9 oz lime jello (3 3oz packages) 3 cup water 3/4 cup mayonnaise 45 oz fruit cocktail thoroughly drained (3 15oz cans) 1 1/2 cup chopped pecansINSTRUCTIONSUsing a stand mixer (or a hand mixer + large bowl), whip cream cheese and powdered lime jello on medium-high speed until thoroughly combined, about 5-8 minutes. Remove bowl from mixer.Boil 3 cups of water, then pour boiling water into the bowl with the cream cheese. Use a spatula to stir until the jello has dissolved and cream cheese has melted.Transfer bowl to the refrigerator and chill for 1-2 hours, stirring frequently, until consistency has slightly thickened. Mixture is ready once a ring starts to form along the edges of the bowl.Remove bowl from refrigerator. Add mayonnaise, fruit cocktail, and chopped pecans to bowl, then stir thoroughly until mayonnaise has dissolved into the liquid.Spray a 16 cup bundt pan (standard bundt pan size) with cooking spray, then pour the jello salad mixture inside. Use a spatula to smooth out the top so that there aren't any producing pieces of pecans or fruit.Place bundt pan in the refrigerator and chill until jello is completely set, usually anywhere from 3-5 hours. For best results, let jello set overnight.When ready to serve, remove bundt pan from refrigerator. Place a serving dish over the top of the bundt pan, then hold the plate in place while flipping the bundt pan over (so that the bundt pan ends up on top of the plate). If the jello doesn't immediately fall out, lift the bundt pan up about 1 inch and gently shake downwards; jello should quickly fall out.Creamy jello salad can be served immediately or stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.@@@@Molded Egg SaladIngredients3 tablespoons unflavored gelatin 3/4 cups cold water 3 cups boiling water 1/4 cup sugar 3/4 cup lemon juice 6 hard-cooked eggs 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup chopped parsley 1/2 cup chopped celery 1/2 cup chopped green olivesHow to Make ItStep 1Soften the gelatin in cold water in a heatproof bowl.

This option saves preparation time.In a large bowl, mix together lemon and orange JELL-O.  Add 2 cups boiling water and stir 2 minutes until dissolved.  Stir in 1 1/2 cup cold water.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to a soft-set gelatin mixture.After 1 hour, remove gelatin mixture from the refrigerator and stir in the bananas and pineapple.  Pineapple and bananas should look suspended or floating in the gelatin (it is fine for the marshmallows to float to the top).  Pour the mixture into a glass serving bowl or a rectangular glass pan (you will be able to see the JELL-O and floating fruit).  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight until the gelatin mixture in hard set.Always store gelatin desserts in a covered container to avoid the formation of a thick rubbery skin on the surface.Option 2 - Prepare separate layer for each JELL-O flavor and topping.  I personally think this is the prettier way to serve this dish.  I know, it takes more time to prepare - but if something is worth doing it is worth doing right!In a medium-size bowl, dissolve the lemon gelatin in 1 cup boiling water, stirring for 2 minutes with a rubber spatula until all the crystals are dissolved.  Stir in 3/4 cup of cold water.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to a soft-set gelatin mixture.After 1 hour, remove lemon gelatin mixture from the refrigerator and stir in the pineapple.  Pineapple should look suspended or floating in the gelatin.  Pour the pineapple gelatin mixture into a glass serving dish, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 4 hours until the gelatin mixture is hard set.Once the lemon gelatin mixture is hard set, prepare the orange gelatin.In a separate bowl, mix together the orange gelatin with 1 cup boiling water, stirring 2 minutes with a rubber spatula until all the crystal are dissolved.  Stir in 3/4 cup of cold water.  Add the miniature marshmallows and stir to combine (marshmallows will float to the top and this is fine).  Gently spoon the orange gelatin mixture over the top of the hard-set lemon gelatin.  You do not want to pour the orange gelatin mixture over the top of the lemon gelatin layer as it will create a hole in the lemon layer.  This will also lose the nice layered effect separating each gelatin color. So - gently spoon!Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour to soft-set gelatin.  After 1 hour, remove the orange gelatin from the refrigerator.  Layer the top of the orange gelatin with the sliced bananas.  Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours or overnight.Store gelatin desserts in a covered container to avoid the formation of a thick rubbery skin on the surface.Prepare Toppings:Pineapple Topping - In a large saucepan over low heat, stir together the sugar, flour, reserved pineapple juice and beaten egg.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce just starts to boil and thicken(if cooked too quickly on high heat, the egg will separate).  Immediately remove from heat when you see the sauce bubble up and start to rise.  Pour the sauce into a small bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let cool in the refrigerator (you can speed up the cooling time in the freezer for 1 hour).Whipped Topping - In a separate mixing bowl on medium speed, beat together the whipped topping (or whipped cream) and cream cheese until soft peaks form.  If making homemade whipping cream, add sugar to sweeten to taste.  Set aside until ready to serve.  Refrigerate if not serving immediately.Option 3 - Pineapple mixture can be folded into the prepared Whipped Topping and then spread over the top of the gelatin.To Serve:Approximately 1 hour before serving, remove the gelatin dessert from the refrigerator.  Spoon the Pineapple Topping over the top of the Gelatin Dessert, spreading evenly to cover.  Then spread the Whipped Topping over the top of the Pineapple Topping until the top is completely covered.Cover with plastic wrap and place back in the refrigerator until ready to serve. Sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese over the top for garnish right before serving.Recipe Notes*  Do not use fresh pineapple as it contains protein-splitting enzymes that will prevent the gelatin from setting.@@@@Bacon Fat CakeMakes 1 9-inch cakeIngredients2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour1 3/4 cups granulated white sugar1 1/2 teaspoons salt1/2 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon baking powder3/4 cup olive oil1/2 cup rendered bacon fat1 1/4 cups milk or cream3 large eggsZest of 1 whole orange1/2 cup fresh orange juice1 tablespoon vanilla extractDirectionsPreheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Lay the bear carcass out on your large table or suspend the bear from its hind legs about 3 feet from the ground using your chain, hook and upright. Cut off the layers of fat with your hunting knife. Bears have two types of fat: The outer layer is jelly-like while the layer closer to the muscle is firmer, like beef tallow. Use carefully executed cuts to shave off the fat in chunks, getting as close to the red bear meat as possible. Discard the fat or reserve the pieces to render into bear lard or grease. Remove the fillets. To do this, saw the sternum down the middle then split the rib cage into two halves. The tenderloins or fillets are the muscles that run along the spine from the bottom of the rib cage to just before the hind legs. Reserve these if you want bear steaks or simply cube into roughly 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 inch pieces like you will be doing to the rest of the bear meat. Peel the meat from the ribs. Insert the knife just under the rib meat on the outside of the animal's rib cage making a generous incision. Run your knife along flesh and the rib bones as you pull the meat back, peeling off the rib meat. Remove the meat from the front and back legs. Holding out the limb, use your knife to cut the meat, sinew and tendons away from shoulder and hip joints and then saw off each limb at the exposed joint. Cut meat away from each leg and cube. Strip and cube the remaining meat from the carcass. The remaining meat will mostly be around the shoulders. Place cubes of meat in an airtight container or in plastic bags. Place in your refrigerator or freezer, or grind with spices and other meat (traditionally pork) to make ground meat for hamburgers or sausage.Skin your bear so that you are left with a headless and paw-less carcass covered in layers of white fat.

Squeeze out the feces, but don’t wash the anus or intestine. Make a fire and throw the juicy anus directly into it, ignore the dirt and ashes that will cover the anus. When the anus is al dente – be sure not to cook it too long – cut it into bite sized pieces and serve immediately.@@@@Icelandic Rotten SharkTake one large shark, gut and discard the innards, the cartilage and the head. Cut flesh into large pieces.Wash in running water to get all slime and blood off. Dig a large hole in coarse gravel, preferably down by the sea and far from the nearest inhabited house - this is to make sure the smell doesn't bother anybody. Put in the shark pieces, and press them well together. It's best to do this when the weather is fairly warm (but not hot), as it hastens the curing process. Cover with more gravel and put heavy rocks on top to press down. Leave for 6-7 weeks (in summer) to 2-3 months (in winter). During this time, fluid will drain from the shark flesh, and putrefication will set in. When the shark is soft and smells like ammonia, remove from the gravel, wash, and hang in a drying shack. This is a shack or shed with plenty of holes to let the wind in, but enough shade to prevent the sun from shining directly on the shark. Let it hang until it is firm and fairly dry: 2-4 months. Warm, windy and dry weather will hasten the process, while cold, damp and still weather will delay it. Slice off the brown crust, cut the whitish flesh into small pieces and serve, preferably with a shot of ice-cold brennivín.The modern method for curing shark relies on putting it into a large container with a drainage hole, and letting it cure as it does when buried in gravel. @@@@Bulgarian Lamb Soup1/2 pound shoulder lamb, fat removed and diced1 teaspoon salt3 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped3 green peppers, seeded and chopped1 large onion, chopped2 tablespoons rice2 tablespoons butter2 tablespoons flour1 cup lamb broth2 egg yolks, slightly beaten1/2 cup yoghurtGrated peel and juice of 1/2 lemonSalt and pepperFinely chopped parsleySprinkle the lamb with the teaspoon of salt.

Be sure to use approximately 3 parts water and 1 part soybeans to allow for expansion. You will end up with 8 to 12 cups of beans.    Drain the beans from the soaking water. Place beans in a large pot, fill with water and boil for 9 hours.    Drain the cooked beans and place in a sterilized pot. Dissolve one special spoonful of natto spores into 2 teaspoons of sterilized water.    While the beans are still warm, pour the natto spore solution over the beans. Stir the beans and water mixture together carefully using a sterilized spoon.    Place a thin layer of beans in each of the 3 to 4 containers. If at any point during the process some beans are spilled on the counter, etc., discard the spilled beans as they can contaminate the other beans if added back in to the batch.    Place the sterilized cheese cloth over the top of the containers and place the tight-fitting lid over the cheese cloth. Preheat the oven or a dehydrator to 100°F.    Place the covered containers in the oven, dehydrator, or warmer and allow the natto to ferment for 22 to 24 hours being sure to keep the temperature steady at 100°F.    At the conclusion of the fermentation period, let the natto cool for a couple of hours, then remove the lid and the cloth, replace the lid, and store the containers in the refrigerator at least overnight. The Natto can be consumed as early as the next morning and are often served as a Japanese-style breakfast. Natto can also be aged in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. Smaller portions of finished natto can be stored in the freezer and thawed for later use.@@@@Frog Eye SaladThis yummy pasta and fruit salad is made with Acini de Pepe pasta (the “frog eyes”), pineapple juice and tidbits, mandarin orange slices, and marshmallows.

Rinse the whole pluck in cold water. Trim off any large pieces of fat and cut away the windpipe.2. Place in a good sized pot and cover with cold water. The lungs float, so keep submerged with a plate or a lid. Bring to the boil and skim the surface regularly. Gently simmer for 2 hours.3. Lift the meat from the pot with tongs or a slotted spoon, and rinse in cold water to remove any scum. Place into a bowl and leave to cool.4. Strain cooking liquid through a fine sieve and put back on the stove to reduce until you have roughly 500–1l of stock. Leave to cool.5. Whilst the stock reduces, finely dice the cooked heart and lungs. Grate the liver using the coarse side of the grater. Finely dice the trimmings. Mix together in a large bowl, along with the suet, oatmeal and spices.6. Measure how much stock remains from cooking the pluck, and make up to 1l with cold water. When cool, add to the haggis mixture.7. To check the seasoning, pan fry a tablespoon of the mixture for 2–3 minutes and taste. Add any extra salt, pepper or spice if needed.8. Spoon the haggis mixture into the soaked, rinsed ox bung. Be aware the filling swells as it cooks, so pack quite loosely, and keep a little bung at each end.9. When the haggis is the size required, expel any extra air, pinch, tie with string and cut with scissors.10. Tie the new end of the bung, and continue stuffing. Freeze any spare haggises.11.

I've tried this before but recently I had a couple breakthroughs in Tico meat technology. I was at a graduation recently where the host bought 60 pounds of Tico meat and had it in a big vat. I got to see it in bulk up close and that really helped. The other thing I did was buy a Tico burger and bring it home for dissection. Here are the results:There were 2 surprising conclusions from my dissection.1) There is oatmeal in the meat.2) There are NO onions in the meat.Aside from that, one thing that I noticed was that the meat was pretty silky and gooey. It made me think that there was cream of mushroom soup or something in the mix, but there wasn't. I'll explain below. The other thing to notice about the meat is that it was broken up into very fine particles. I got pretty darn close with my attempt tonight. I got the color, texture and taste close enough that I couldn't tell the difference.1 pound hamburger1 cup water1/3 cup oatmeal, briefly pulsed in the coffee grinder2 T butter1 t chili powder1/4 t pepper1/8th t MSG1 t onion salt1/2 t garlic salt1/4 t ground cumin1/2 t salt1 t vinegarTo get the meat into really fine particles, put water and meat in the bottom of a skillet and stir up using a fork and a potato masher. Keep going until it is really well broken up. Next add the rest of the ingredients and brown the meat. As you simmer it the meat will get a little soupy and gooey like this:Keep simmering, uncovered, until the meat is nice and thick like this:Enjoy it in tacos or burritos or sanchos!@@@@Ham and Bananas HollandaiseIngredients:6 medium bananas1/4 cup lemon juice6 thin slices boiled ham (about 1/2 lb)3 tablespoons prepared mustard2 envelopes (1 1/4-oz size) hollandaise sauce mix1/4 cup light cream1.

(It’s helpful to do this over a colored mixing bowl so you can see the water.) Allow the washed rice to drain in the strainer.Cook the washed rice in a rice cooker with the amount of water specified by your rice cooker. (I used 3 cups of water for this amount.) I’ve never, ever screwed up rice in a rice cooker so long as I cover the rice with water by about an inch. If you don’t have a rice cooker, follow the directions on your rice package.In a small pot over low heat, combine the caper brine, sugar, and vinegar and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool.Set a large mixing bowl next to an electric fan or a friend—turn the fan to low or have your friend wave a magazine over the rice. When the rice is done, use a bamboo paddle or spatula to gently remove portions of it from the cooker and spread them out around the inside of the large bowl. Removing it in portions exposes more surface area and allows for more rapid cooling. Once all of the rice is in the bowl, dribble the vinegar mixture onto the paddle while moving it back and forth a few inches above the rice, so as to thinly and evenly distribute all of the seasoned vinegar over all of the rice. Use the paddle to gently break up any chunks of rice in “slicing” motions. When the clumps are broken and cease to re-form, you can be sure that all of the rice has been seasoned. When ready, the rice should glisten and feel warm, but not hot, to the touch. Turn off the fan or dismiss your friend.Wet your hands with water (the rice is very sticky) and, using your hands, gently transfer the rice to a cooler (which keeps it from getting too cold) or to a wooden bowl. Run a clean, lint-free hand towel under warm water until entirely moistened and cover the rice until ready to use, or for up to 2 hours. If you use a cooler, close the lid. If using a wooden bowl, cover with plastic wrap.For the	wasabi cream cheeseMix the wasabi powder and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl until dissolved. Add the cream cheese to the bowl and use a rubber spatula to fully incorporate the wasabi.For the	everything bagel mixCombine all the ingredients for the everything bagel mix in a small pan. Toast until fragrant. Transfer to a small plate to cool.For the	nigiriPlace the warm rice, wasabi cream cheese, seasoning mix, and sliced fish in close proximity. Wet your hands with water. With your dominant hand, grab less than a Ping Pong ball’s but a little more than a shooter marble’s worth of rice. Gently squeeze it so it’s about the length and diameter of a fat wine-bottle cork. Too much squeezing makes the rice like clay, too little and it falls apart. (Luckily the recipe above makes enough rice for you and your guests to practice.) Once the rice ball is formed, slide it a bit lower in your palm and hold onto it. Pick up a slice of fish with your nondominant hand. With your dominant pointer finger (rice ball still clutched) swipe a little wasabi cream cheese onto the fish. Gently press the rice ball onto the cream cheese–smeared fish in your nondominant hand. Flip the nigiri fish-side up in your nondominant hand, and gently apply pressure with two fingers of your dominant hand and a cupping motion from your nondominant hand. Rotate the fish and rice ball 180 degrees and repeat, so as to round off the corners and strongly adhere the fish to the rice ball. See the diagram below.Gently press the top of the fish into the everything bagel mix; it should stick to the surface of the fish.Place the nigiri on a plate, top with as few or as many garnishes as you like, and serve. Have your guests eat these quickly, as the rice will dry out if left unconsumed.Continue forming nigiri, rewetting your hands as needed to keep the rice from sticking to your hands.Mince some fresh dill and cook it with your sushi rice. It will perfume it with its sweet, almost minty flavor. This will freshen up the oily fish nicely.@@@@CHERRY JELLYIngredientsstones and stalks from 2 pounds clear, fine, ripe cherries, 1/4  pound red currants, juice from these fruits, 3/4 pound clarified sugar, one ounce isinglass, 1 1/2 pound sugarDirectionsTake the stones and stalks from two pounds of clear, fine, ripe cherries; mix them with a quarter of a pound of red currants, from which the seeds have been extracted; express the juice from these fruits; filter, and mix it with three quarters of a pound of clarified sugar, and one ounce of isinglass.

To make it according to the standard recipes is so expensive and tedious that few persons care to attempt it. The following directions will enable a cook to make an excellent and clear aspic.Cut two pounds of lean beefsteak or veal cutlet into dice, put it on in two quarts of cold water, and as soon as it boils, take off the scum as it rises. Let it simmer gently for half-an-hour; then add four onions, a turnip, carrot, small bundle of sweet herbs, blade of mace, half-a-dozen white peppercorns, and when it has again boiled for an hour strain it through a napkin. Let it stand until cold, remove all the fat, boil it up, and to a quart of the liquor put an ounce of Nelson's Gelatine, previously soaked in cold water. Add salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper, and when the jelly is cool stir in the whites and shells of two eggs well beaten. Let the jelly boil briskly for two minutes, let it stand off the fire for a few minutes, then strain through a jelly-bag and use as directed. Take the fillets of a pair of large thick soles, cut them into neat square pieces, leaving the trimmings for other dishes, and lay them in vinegar with a little salt for an hour. As they must be kept very white the best French vinegar should be used. Boil the fillets gently in salted water, with a little vinegar, till done; take them up and dry them on a cloth. Have ready some picked parsley and hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters; arrange these neatly at the bottom of a plain mould so as to form a pretty pattern. Pour in very gently enough jelly to cover the first layer, let it stand until beginning to set, then put another layer of fish, eggs, and parsley, then more jelly, and so on until the mould is full.

You can add whatever veggies you typically use when making bone broth. I like celery, onions, carrots (though I add this later) and lots of garlic (with skins).For spices, I used a combination of bay leaves, peppercorns, rosemary, oregano, basil, and of course my favorite coarse salt, Celtic Salt.Turn the slow cooker on high and bring to a boiling point. When it reaches a gentle simmer, add carrot and reduce heat to the lowest possible setting and cook for 8 hours (I usually leave this overnight and process it in the morning).By now, the pork trotters should be falling apart and you should have a very rich, gelatinous bone broth. Divide previously cooked meat of choice in small ramekins or other glassware containers such as pint-size mason jars.Double strain the broth into a large bowl (I like using this for ease and simplicity) making sure you’re left with very clear, clean golden liquid. If you don’t have a fine-mesh sieve, spread a cheesecloth on a regular sieve to catch all herbs and other debris.Add fresh minced garlic to the broth and pour into the containers. Add a slice of cooked carrot to each container for garnish and dill or parsley. Discard pork trotters and veggies as you would when making bone broth.Set aspic in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. Traditionally, aspic should be served with dijon mustard or horseradish paste.If you’re going for convenience, small jelly jars or other small containers (with lids) works best. It makes for an easy lunch packing during hectic mornings. If you’re wanting to impress your friends and family, perhaps a bundt pan would look extra fancy.Instructions    Toss all ingredients but carrots and cooked meat into a slow cooker.    Turn the slow cooker on high and bring to a boiling point. When it reaches a gentle simmer, add carrot and reduce heat to the lowest possible setting and cook for 8 hours (I usually leave this overnight and process it in the morning).    Divide previously cooked meat of choice between small containers.    Double strain the broth into a large bowl making sure you’re left with very clear, clean golden liquid. Discard pork trotters and veggies as you would when making bone broth (chickens, compost, or trash).    Add 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic in the broth and pour into the containers.    Add a slice of cooked carrot to each container for garnish and dill or parsley.    Set aspic in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours.    It’s best served with rye bread and Dijon mustard.@@@@Banana Walnut JelloIngredients    3 oz    box of red jello, usually strawberry banana    1 c    boiling water    1 c    cold water    2    bananas, sliced    1 c    walnutsIn a medium-sized bowl, stir together the Jello & the boiling water.

(Yes, you could put this in the fridge if you're sure you'll remember to take it out in about 20-25 minutes, BEFORE it sets. I can't seem to remember this, even with a timer.)Slice the bananas into the slightly thickened Jello. Make sure all the bananas are covered so they don't darken soon. Add in the walnuts.

Float your fish upsidedown on top, and add a plastic skeleton or two. Haven't figured out a good way to put something on the bottom to represent the sand, tho@@@@Jellied Chicken SaladIngredients1 1/2 tablespoons unflavored gelatin 1/4 cup cold water 1 consommé, heated 1 tablespoon chopped onion 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 cup chopped cooked chicken 1 cup cooked peas 2 tablespoon chopped celery 2 tablespoons chopped pickleHow to Make ItSoften the gelatin in water in a heatproof bowl, then add consommé and stir until dissolved.

My family's approach was that if you didn't have enough raisins (or just didn't want that many raisins) you threw in some extra currants, or you chopped some dried apricots or cherries or whatever, as long as you end up with a bit more than 3-1/2 quarts of fruit and you have enough tart fruit to balance the sweet.Equipment:Large heavy saucepotThe usual kit - sharp knife, cutting surface, measuring cups...Crock or gallon-sized glass jar, sterilized - or -Canning jars and lids, pressure canner if you're going to can itIngredients:1 quart cooked tender beefsteak, chopped (not ground)1 cup chopped suet2 cups seedless raisins2 cups currants, washed (note, these are fresh currants which are hard to find. If you can’t get them, use dried, unsweetened currants and steam them to plump; or substitute chopped tart cherries)2 cups chopped candied citron (The citron is important. If you can’t find good citron, use 1-1/2 cup candied lemon peel and 1/2 cup candied ginger – it’ll taste different from citron but it is good)2 quarts chopped, tart, peeled apples1 quart apple cider4 lemons (juice, pulp, and grated zest)4 cups packed brown sugar4 teaspoons salt4 teaspoons cinnamon4 teaspoons allspice1 teaspoon ground cloves1/2 cup brandyAdditional brandy or rum for topping upMethod:Put everything except the brandy in a large, heavy saucepan. Cook at a low simmer for about an hour and a half, stirring frequently; don’t let it scorch. When everything is tender but not mushed, remove it from the heat. Stir in the brandy.At this point you have three choices:1. Traditional – pack into a sterilized crock (or gallon-sized sterilized glass jar). Cover and cool. Some of the suet will rise to the top, forming a seal, and that’s a good thing. Place in a cool location. Each week, stir in another glug of brandy or rum.2. Modern – pack while still hot into sterilized jars and process in a pressure canner.3. Impatient – Refrigerate immediately. Use to prepare pie within three days, adding additional rum or brandy if more liquid is needed in your pie filling recipe.This recipe makes something like 3 quarts of mincement (enough for three generously-sized pies).@@@@Duck salad1 small head lettuce, shreddedSix large peach halves1 cup cottage cheese6 yellow marshmallows12 currants1/2 cup toasted almondsArrange shredded lettuce on large glass platter or chop plate, fluffing it up with a fork to resemble waves.
