# jello
crowdsourced dataset of vintage jello-centric recipes

This is the result of a weeks-long crowdsourcing effort in early 2020, where I decided to find out just how terrible neural net recipes could get.

I eventually finetuned GPT-2 345M on this dataset and posted a summary of the results here (they are terrible):

Dataset stats:

- over 800 entries
- Names of authors and titles are not standardized, nor are typos corrected.
- All entries are in English; a few are in a very archaic form of English
- not all contain gelatin, but most do.

Anyone who has read my blog aiweirdness.com or who has read my book on AI, You Look Like A Thing and I Love You knows that AI generated recipes tend to be bad. 

Like, horseradish in brownies bad. Or another that contained garlic, chocolate chips, and wine.

How much worse could they get? Let's find out.

I'm going to collect a dataset of vintage American-style recipes, the kind with jello and/or inadvisable combinations of shrimp, jam, and ketchup. Then when I have enough, I'm going to train a neural network to generate more. 

This is where you come in.  A neural net needs examples to learn from, and I haven't been able to find a big enough list of concentrated strangeness. So I'm hoping the good citizens of the internet can help me.
 
Use this form to enter as many as you like, the weirder the better.  Don't worry about formatting or duplicate recipes. Please try to include title, ingredients, and directions.
